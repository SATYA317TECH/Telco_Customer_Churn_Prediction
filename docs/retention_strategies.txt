TELCO CUSTOMER CHURN – RETENTION STRATEGIES
==========================================

Project Context
---------------
This document outlines the business retention strategies derived from the
customer churn prediction model. High-risk customers are identified using
a Logistic Regression model with a tuned probability threshold of 0.42.
Retention actions are mapped based on the dominant churn drivers.


CHURN DECISION FRAMEWORK
-----------------------
IF churn_probability >= 0.40:
    Customer is classified as HIGH RISK
    Apply targeted retention strategy
ELSE:
    No retention action required


CORE RETENTION STRATEGIES
------------------------

1. PRICE-SENSITIVE CUSTOMERS
----------------------------
Identified By:
- High monthly_charges
- High charges_per_month
- Month-to-month contract

Reason for Churn:
Customers perceive the service as expensive relative to value.

Retention Actions:
- Offer targeted discounts (5–15%)
- Suggest plan downgrade with same benefits
- Provide bundled services at no extra cost

Business Note:
Avoid blanket discounts. Apply only to high-risk customers.


2. EARLY TENURE / NEW CUSTOMERS
-------------------------------
Identified By:
- tenure_months < 6
- tenure_bucket_0-6

Reason for Churn:
Poor onboarding experience or unmet expectations.

Retention Actions:
- Proactive welcome call
- Free add-on service for 1–2 months
- Usage education and onboarding support

Business Note:
Early intervention has the highest ROI in churn reduction.


3. CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE (CX) RISK
--------------------------------
Identified By:
- High cx_risk_score
- High avg_resolution_time
- Low avg_satisfaction_score

Reason for Churn:
Customers feel frustrated due to slow or poor support.

Retention Actions:
- Priority customer support queue
- Dedicated support representative
- Apology credit or goodwill compensation

Business Note:
Improving CX often reduces churn more effectively than discounts.


4. BILLING & PAYMENT FRICTION
-----------------------------
Identified By:
- payment_method = Electronic Check
- Late payments
- High billing complaints

Reason for Churn:
Payment inconvenience and billing confusion.

Retention Actions:
- Incentivize auto-pay enrollment
- Simplify billing structure
- Payment reminders and alerts

Business Note:
Operational fixes can significantly reduce churn at low cost.


5. LOW ENGAGEMENT / LOW STICKINESS
---------------------------------
Identified By:
- Low engagement_score
- Low stickiness_score

Reason for Churn:
Customer does not rely heavily on the service.

Retention Actions:
- Promote add-on services
- Offer bundled features
- Personalized usage recommendations

Business Note:
Increasing dependency reduces switching likelihood.


ADVANCED / OPTIONAL STRATEGIES
------------------------------

6. CONTRACT MIGRATION STRATEGY
------------------------------
Identified By:
- Month-to-month contract
- High churn probability

Retention Actions:
- Incentivize upgrade to 1-year or 2-year contract
- Offer upfront benefit (discount, free service month)

Business Note:
Long-term contracts are one of the strongest churn reducers.


7. HIGH-VALUE CUSTOMER PROTECTION
---------------------------------
Identified By:
- Long tenure
- High total_charges
- High customer lifetime value

Retention Actions:
- Loyalty rewards
- Personalized offers
- Dedicated account management

Business Note:
Protect high-value customers proactively.


8. NO-ACTION SEGMENT (COST OPTIMIZATION)
----------------------------------------
Identified By:
- Low churn probability
- Long tenure
- High stickiness

Retention Actions:
- No intervention required
- Avoid unnecessary discounts

Business Note:
Retention budget should not be wasted on low-risk customers.


9. A/B TESTING & EXPERIMENTATION
-------------------------------
Identified By:
- High-risk customers

Retention Actions:
- Test discount vs CX intervention
- Measure churn reduction across strategies

Business Note:
Continuous experimentation improves long-term retention strategy.


FINAL NOTE
----------
The churn prediction model is designed not only to predict churn but to drive
actionable business decisions. Retention strategies are applied selectively
based on churn drivers to maximize customer retention while optimizing cost.
